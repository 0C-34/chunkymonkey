Status
======

Chunky Monkey is currently in early development and does not yet run games.

Requirements
============

The Go toolchain must be installed.  For more information, see:
http://golang.org/doc/install.html#fetch

Building
========

Godag is used to build chunkymonkey, see:
http://code.google.com/p/godag/wiki/Install

$ ./build.sh

Running
=======

Serve up a single player world:

$ ./chunkymonkey ~/.minecraft/saves/World1
2010/10/03 16:32:13 Listening on  :25565

Record/replay
=============

For debugging it is often useful to record a player's actions and replay them
one or more times later.  This makes it possible to simulate multiplayer games
without having real people logging in.

To record a session:

$ ./chunkymonkey --record player.log ~/.minecraft/saves/World1

To replay a session:

$ ./chunkymonkey --replay player.log ~/.minecraft/saves/World1 &
$ java -jar Minecraft.jar  # start the first player (real human)
$ nc localhost 25565       # start the second player (replay from log file)

The recorded player will start when the second client connects to the server.
Use netcat or a similar tool to start an otherwise idle TCP connection to the
server.
