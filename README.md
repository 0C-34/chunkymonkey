Chunky Monkey is a Minecraft Alpha multiplayer server.  It is licensed under
the MIT open source license, please see the LICENSE file for more information.

Website: http://github.com/huin/chunkymonkey
Contact: [John Beisley][3]

Status
------

Chunky Monkey is currently in early development and does not yet run anything
that could be considered a full game experience.

Minecraft Beta clients may connect and walk around a world generated by Alpha
Notchian code (more recent generated worlds have not yet been tested), blocks
may be dug.

Chunky Monkey is looking for assistance in furthering its development.

Key skills:

*   Use of Git and Github.
*   Moderate skill in the Go programming language.
*   Ability to write clear, maintainable code.
*   Unit testing knowledge.
*   Understanding of goroutine concurrency primitives.

Highly desireable skills:

*   Cellular automata for the purposes of world block physics.
*   Embedding a scripting environment (perhaps Lua?) into Go.
*   Low-latency reliable network communication.
*   Server scalabilty and reliability architecture.
*   Service monitoring.
*   World generation (including noise generation).

If you're interested in working on the project - it's best to contact [Huin][3]
via Github, or on the Freenode IRC network in the #mcdevs channel.


Requirements
------------

The [Go toolchain][1] must be installed.


Building
--------

[Godag][2] is used to build chunkymonkey. Install it, and run:

    $ ./build.sh

Running
-------

Serve up a single player world:

    $ ./chunkymonkey ~/.minecraft/saves/World1
    2010/10/03 16:32:13 Listening on  :25565

Record/replay
-------------

For debugging it is often useful to record a player's actions and replay them
one or more times later.  This makes it possible to simulate multiplayer games
without having real people logging in.

To record a session:

    $ ./chunkymonkey --record player.log ~/.minecraft/saves/World1

To replay a session:

    $ ./chunkymonkey --replay player.log ~/.minecraft/saves/World1 &
    $ java -jar Minecraft.jar  # start the first player (real human)
    $ nc localhost 25565       # start the second player (replay from log file)

The recorded player will start when the second client connects to the server.
Use netcat or a similar tool to start an otherwise idle TCP connection to the
server.
