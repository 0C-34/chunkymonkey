========

This directory contains the following commands:

*  `chunkymonkey` - The server itself.
*  `datatests` - Performs some basic tests on the data JSON files that the
   server uses.
*  `dumpblockdefs` - Dumps JSON block definitions.
*  `inspectlevel` - Inspects Minecraft world state directories.
*  `intercept` - A proxy minecraft server that logs packets for inspection, and
   can also record them for playback by the `replay` command.
*  `noise` - A program intended to display output of landscape generation for
   experimental purposes.
*  `replay` - Replays packet logs recorded by `intercept` to a minecraft
   server. Useful for repeatedly testing a sequence of (multiple?) player
   actions without performing them manually each time.
